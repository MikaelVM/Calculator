# Calculator
Development of a simple calculator.

# Requirements
## Priority 1 - The basic calculator
- Take 2 numbers as input.
- User should be able to chose 1 of the following operations: +, -, * and /.
- Provide the result of the operation.
## Priority 2 - Expanded Calculator
- Program must continue after providing the result to make further calculations.
- Program must have a specific command to terminate, like 'q' for quit.
## Priority 3 - Advanced Calculator
- Support operators for square root and power.
- Have input validation.
- Possibly make the code more modular and organized.

# Development notes
Various notes to help me recall what the next step in development are.

## The calculator being a parser
The Calculator is in essence a parser, it takes in a string and produces an output. 

Research patterns to develop parser, as they could provide a more optimized solution.
- Verify whether binary trees could be part of the solution.
